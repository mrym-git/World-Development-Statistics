Some countries achieve high income without proportional increases in life expectancy, while others improve health outcomes despite lower income. This project explores the relationship between GNI per capita and life expectancy to identify gaps in global development.

## Executive Summary

We analyzed World Bank datasets on **GNI per capita** and **life expectancy**, performing EDA, visualizations, and statistical tests. The analysis shows:

* A strong positive relationship between income and life expectancy, though the effect levels off at very high incomes.
* Regional disparities: Europe and the Americas are clustered at the top, while Africa lags behind.
* Outliers highlight mismatches, with some wealthy nations underperforming and some middle-income nations exceeding expectations.

Key takeaway: **Economic growth matters, but investments in healthcare, education, and governance are equally essential for improving human well-being.**

## Files

* `data/cleaned_data.csv` — final merged dataset with engineered features
* `notebooks/analysis_notebook.ipynb` — main analysis notebook
* `visuals/` — charts and key figures

## Data

* Source: [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/](https://www.gapminder.org/about/)
* Features: country, year, gni_per_capita, life_expectancy, continent, predicted_life

## Conclusions & Recommendations

* Invest in healthcare and education to raise life expectancy.
* Focus on reducing regional disparities, especially in Africa.
* Learn from outliers to adapt successful policies.
* Balance economic growth with social equity for sustainability.
